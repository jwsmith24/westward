# Westward

The concept:

The player is one of dozens of adventurers who have accepted the call to explore an uncharted continent to the West 
that was recently discovered. A small town serving as an operations hub has been established on the easternmost coast.

The game loop involves the player taking on quests to explore and ultimately map the uncharted regions which is done 
by collecting data with their arcane device called the Cartographer.
